# week-2
JavaScript provides us five different loops; for, for/in, for/of, while and do/while. For example, a while loop would be used when the number of attempts is unknown, until the condition is met. This may be be happen in a card game where a player draws a card until they draw one they can apply. An example of a while loop may look like this:

```javascript
let i = 1, n = 7;
while (i <= n) {
    console.log(i);
    i += 1;
}
```


A for loop is used when when you want to repeat a set of statements an indefinite number of times, until a condition is satisfied. This might be used for a ball collector at a driving range or number of dishes that need to be washed. The loop continues until runs out of things to do. 
```
// program to display text 10 times
const n = 10;

// looping from i = 1 to 10   
for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    console.log(`wash dishes mindfully, almost there.`);
}
```


For/of loops will loop through every single element for a given string or array. It wont determine where to start or how long to go on for. So it only happens once. It can be described as straight forward up restricting for this reasoning. And example of a for-of loop is:
const array1 = ['x, ‘y’, ‘z’];
            
for (const element of array1}{
console.log (element)
}

// expected output: “x”
// expected output: “y”
// expected output: “z”

Instructions
As developers, research is a constant part of our job. A common saying is that 90% of software development is Googling, and while that is an exaggeration, Google is a highly used tool in the role. This Research assignment is meant to go beyond the course curriculum and increase your understanding of relevant topics while exposing you to online resources you'll frequently use on the job. Please write a paragraph for two (2) of the above prompts and include URLs from where you found the information to cite your sources. Do not copy and paste text from the internet or any other source; use the information you find in your research, summarize, in your own words, the concepts. Plagiarism will result in a zero for the assignment as well as disciplinary actions.

This assignment is graded based on participation.

Reminder:  Create a .pdf file with your research findings (.pdf is the only accepted file type).
- To save as a .pdf, go to Save As or Export, then choose the file type .pdf. This will save a new version of your document as a .pdf.
- If you have a Mac and use Pages, please make sure to export the final version of the document to a .pdf before submitting.
